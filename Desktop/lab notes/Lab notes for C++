9/4 notes

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, world" << endl;
    return 0;
}

main is always required, tell the compile where the program starts
once leave main, then the program is over, main return into a "int"

basic output
<< compile to cout
" "
<< sheveron 

// the compile will ignore this line, just for notes
/ division 
cout << "Hello" << endl << "world" << endl
endl = "/.n"
";" go at the end of the statement

without a ; means statement continues
use ./(program name you named) to run the program
